# Get your working directory. Your working directory is the path to this file. This may look different for PC users/Mac users.


# Set your working directory:


# Read in the data from the .csv file:
# Use TAB to auto complete
# "file name", - Case and space sensitive!
# header = TRUE - because our data has headers (Column names)


# Check the dimensions of the data



# Summarize your entire data


# View only the first 6 rows of data


# List column names within your data


# Summarize only a specific column by name using $ in your syntax


# View the structure of your data 


# Install the package first:
# Comment your code with a hashtag to avoid running a line a second time. 
# install.packages("tidyverse") 


# Use glimpse() to view the data:


# Select a specific column of your data:


# Use filter to select for a specific species, truncatus, within the column Species
